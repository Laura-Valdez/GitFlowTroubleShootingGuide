Git Flow is a branching model that provides a structured approach to managing branches and releases in a Git repository.

Git Flow is a widely used branching model and workflow for version control in software development projects. It provides a structured approach to managing branches, releases, and collaboration within a Git repository. The Git Flow methodology was developed by Vincent Driessen and has gained popularity due to its clear separation of different stages in the software development lifecycle. This approach promotes collaboration, stability, and a streamlined process for handling feature development, bug fixes, and releases.
